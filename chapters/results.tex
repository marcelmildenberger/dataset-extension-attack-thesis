\section{Experiments}  \label{sec:experiments}

To evaluate the effectiveness of the previously defined \ac{dea}, a series of experiments are conducted using multiple datasets.
These experiments aim to assess the attack’s performance across different encoding schemes and datasets using different execution settings to analyze its ability to reconstruct plaintext information from encoded identifiers.

The primary dataset used is the \texttt{fakename} dataset, which is synthetically generated using the American name set provided by the Fake Name Generator.
This dataset was previously employed in related work by Schaefer et al.~\cite{schaefer2024}, making it a suitable benchmark for comparative evaluation.
It includes realistic combinations of personal identifiers and is well-suited for testing the scalability and reliability of both the \ac{gma} and \ac{dea} pipelines.

The \texttt{fakename} datasets consist of synthetically generated entries, each containing a given name, surname, and date of birth.
These datasets aim to resemble realistic combinations of personal identifiers while ensuring privacy and reproducibility.
For evaluation purposes, multiple dataset instances of varying sizes are used: 1{,}000, 2{,}000, 5{,}000, 10{,}000, 20{,}000, and 50{,}000 entries.

The primary advantage of using this dataset family lies in its scalability.
By maintaining a consistent schema while varying the number of records, the impact of dataset size on the performance and success of the \ac{dea} can be systematically analyzed.
This enables controlled experiments that highlight how the quantity of available data influences re-identification, training quality, and generalization performance of the attack models.

An additional dataset used in this study is the \texttt{euro\_person} dataset provided as part of the simulated data for the ESSnet DI on-the-job training course on record linkage, held in Southampton from 25--28 January 2011.
The dataset was created by Paula McLeod, Dick Heasman, and Ian Forbes from the UK Office for National Statistics and contains realistic, fictionalized personal information intended for the training and evaluation of record linkage techniques.
The \texttt{euro\_person} dataset includes forename (\texttt{PERNAME1}), surname (\texttt{PERNAME2}), and full date of birth composed of day, month, and year, which were concatenated into a single \texttt{DOB\_FULL} attribute for the purposes of this work.
The dataset consist of 26.625 records.
As the dataset also serves as a ground-truth reference for other simulated sources such as Census, CIS, and PRD, it is well-suited for evaluating the precision and completeness of plaintext reconstruction and re-identification in the context of the \ac{dea}.

In addition to the synthetic and benchmark datasets, this thesis also incorporates a curated version of the Titanic passenger manifest, referred to as \texttt{titanic\_full}.
This dataset consists of 891 unique records and includes the fields \texttt{firstname} and \texttt{surname} used for internal tracking.
While not originally intended for record linkage evaluation, the dataset offers a semi-realistic collection of personal identifiers derived from historical records.
It provides a useful test case for examining the impact of natural name diversity, varying name lengths, and non-standard naming formats (e.g., inclusion of titles or parenthetical information) on the performance of both Graph Matching and Dataset Extension Attacks.
Due to the historical and English centric nature of the data, it shares some limitations with other Western-focused datasets used in this work but nonetheless adds valuable variety in terms of name structure and frequency.

The experiments are conducted across a range of settings and scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the \ac{dea}.
Each encoding scheme, namely \ac{bf}, \ac{tsh}, and \ac{tmh}, is tested individually across all datasets as described earlier.
This allows for a direct comparison of reconstruction performance under different privacy-preserving encoding mechanisms.

To additionally analyze how the quantity of the training data affects the \ac{dea}, the preceding \ac{gma} step is executed with varying levels of overlap between Alice's and Eve's datasets.
For each dataset and encoding scheme, the \ac{gma} is run multiple times with overlap ratios ranging from 20\% to 80\%, in increments of 20\%.
This simulates different real world scenarios where the attacker has access to varying amounts of auxiliary information.
The resulting re-identifications from the \ac{gma} then serve as the labeled training data for the \ac{dea}, thus allowing for a detailed evaluation of how overlap levels influence overall reconstruction success.

In addition to varying dataset sizes and overlap levels, different attacker scenarios are considered by employing different drop from strategies to evaluate the robustness of the \ac{dea} under more and less realistic assumptions.
The first scenario, Eve's auxiliary dataset $D_e$ is a strict subset of Alice's dataset $D_p$, i.e., $D_e \subseteq D_p$.
In this case, the overlap $o$ is defined as the ratio $o = \frac{|D_e|}{|D_p|}$.
The elements in $D_e$ are generated by randomly sampling $|D_e| = \lfloor o \cdot |D_p| \rfloor$ records from $D_p$ without replacement.
While this setup simplifies evaluation and isolates the impact of training data availability, it is also highly idealized and does not reflect the complexity of real world linkage scenarios.

To address this, a second, more realistic setting is also considered, where both $D_p$ and $D_e$ contain disjoint as well as overlapping individuals.
That is, $D_e \nsubseteq D_p$, but $D_e \cap D_p \neq \emptyset$.
In this scenario, the auxiliary and target datasets each include individuals not present in the other, simulating cases where Eve has partial but non exclusive knowledge of the data.
This setup introduces additional challenges for both the \ac{gma} and \ac{dea}, as structural mismatches and auxiliary noise may degrade re-identification and reconstruction accuracy.

This setup mirrors the experimental methodology employed by \cite{schaefer2024}, ensuring consistency and comparability with prior work on the \ac{gma}.
By varying the overlap rate and dataset composition in this way, a diverse range of re-identification scenarios is created, which directly impacts the amount and quality of training data available for the \ac{dea}.
This, in turn, enables a systematic evaluation of the \ac{dea}'s ability to generalize from partially re-identified data.
As the \ac{gma} identifies different subsets of individuals under varying overlap conditions, the resulting re-identification sets are used to train the neural network, while the remaining non matched records serve as the test set.
Thus, each experiment yields a distinct train-test split, providing a rich basis for assessing the reconstruction capabilities of the \ac{dea} under different supervision levels and graph-matching outcomes.

For the \ac{dea} specific configuration, several fixed settings were employed to ensure comparability across all experimental conditions.
First, the dataset of re-identified individuals, used as labeled training data, was split into training and validation sets using a fixed 80/20 ratio.
This choice reflects common machine learning practice and provides a balanced compromise between model learning and validation reliability.

One of the most critical components of the \ac{dea} pipeline is the hyperparameter optimization step, which is responsible for identifying the most effective neural network architecture.
For this purpose, a total of 125 trials were conducted for each experimental setting.
This number was chosen to provide sufficient coverage of the hyperparameter space while maintaining computational feasibility.

Each trial, as well as the final training run for the best performing model, was limited to a maximum of 20 training epochs.
While this represents a relatively high upper bound, overfitting is mitigated through the use of early stopping.
Specifically, training was halted if the validation loss did not improve for five consecutive epochs (patience = 5), with a minimum delta of $1 \cdot 10^{-4}$ required to qualify as an improvement.
This strategy ensures both efficient training and effective model selection, especially when performance plateaus early.

The search space for the hyperparameter optimization follows the configuration described in Section~\ref{sec:hmo}.
Throughout the entire \ac{dea} pipeline, the \textbf{Dice coefficient} is used as the objective metric for optimization.
This choice is motivated by its robustness and balanced nature, as it integrates both precision and recall and has consistently yielded the most promising results during preliminary manual testing.

For efficient optimization, the hyperparameter search is executed using $n - 1$ CPU cores, where n is the number of available logical processors.
Additionally and optionally an NVIDIA GPU can be used to accelerate the training of the neural networks during hyperparameter optimization.
This allows for near maximal parallelism during hyperparameter tuning, reducing the total runtime without compromising system stability.

In the final re-identification phase, two reconstruction strategies are evaluated to enable comparative analysis: (1) the greedy, graph-based reconstruction method described in Section~\ref{sec:graphrecon}, and (2) the dictionary-based fuzzy matching approach described in Section~\ref{sec:dictrecon}.
Both methods are deterministic and computationally efficient, making them suitable for large scale experimental evaluation.

The language model based reconstruction method is deliberately excluded from the evaluation.
Despite showing potential in early qualitative testing, its dependence on proprietary models, token-based pricing, and limited reproducibility make it unsuitable for scalable and reproducible experimentation within the current research setting.

All experiments were conducted on a virtual machine running Ubuntu 24.04, equipped with 20 cores of a virtualized AMD processor (QEMU Virtual CPU version 2.5+).
The system was provisioned with 176 GB of RAM and featured an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti GPU with 24 GB of dedicated VRAM.

This high-performance computing setup enabled efficient parallel execution of the hyperparameter optimization trials and accelerated training of the neural networks via GPU.
The extensive memory capacity was particularly beneficial during dataset preprocessing and batch-wise loading of large datasets, ensuring that all encoding schemes and reconstruction strategies could be evaluated without resource bottlenecks.

\section{Evaluation Metrics}  \label{sec:metrics}

The performance of the \ac{dea} is assessed using several metrics that are systematically recorded throughout the experimental runs.

Although the \ac{dea} constitutes an offline attack, meaning the adversary can operate without time constraints once both encoded datasets are available, the runtime of the attack remains a valuable indicator of its practical feasibility.
Therefore, the total runtime as well as the runtime of each individual stage within the \ac{dea} pipeline (e.g., data preprocessing, model training, inference, and reconstruction) is measured and documented.

A central metric for assessing the effectiveness of the attack is the \emph{re-identification rate}.
This metric is defined as the number of individuals that are successfully and correctly re-identified by the \ac{dea}, divided by the total number of individuals who were not matched during the initial \ac{gma}.
A successful re-identification in this context means that the \ac{dea} is able to fully reconstruct the original plaintext attributes of a record such that it exactly matches a record in Alice's encoded dataset.
Thus, the re-identification rate reflects the proportion of previously unmapped individuals that the attacker can recover using the inference based approach.

Another important aspect of evaluating the \ac{dea} is its performance in predicting the correct n-grams, which form the basis for reconstructing plaintext attributes.
To assess the quality of these predictions, several standard classification metrics are con, namely, precision, recall, and the F1-score.

Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted n-grams among all predicted n-grams, thereby quantifying the model’s ability to avoid false positives.
Recall, on the other hand, captures the proportion of true n-grams that were successfully recovered, reflecting the completeness of the reconstruction.
The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, offers a balanced assessment of the model's correctness and coverage.

In the context of this work, the F1-score is of particular interest, as it has shown to be the most reliable metric for quantifying n-gram-level performance.
Moreover, it is mathematically equivalent to the Dice similarity coefficient for binary sets, making it not only interpretable but also consistent with the optimization objective used during the hyperparameter tuning stage (cf. Section~\ref{sec:experiments}).
This alignment ensures that the evaluation metric reflects the actual optimization goal of the \ac{dea}.

To enable a meaningful comparison, the performance of different \ac{dea} configurations is evaluated not only against each other but also against a baseline strategy.
This baseline serves as a lower bound for the expected prediction quality and helps contextualize the improvements achieved through the proposed \ac{dea} attack pipeline.

The baseline approach simulates an attacker who, for each non re-identified individual, simply predicts the $k$ most frequent n-grams across the entire dataset.
The value $k$ is equal to the average length of an entry minus one, as the n-grams are overlapping.
This assumes that the attacker has full access to the distribution of n-grams in the encoded dataset, a reasonable assumption in a research setting, where the dataset is known, but less realistic in real-world attacks.
Still, it provides a practical lower-bound for evaluation.

An analysis of the \texttt{fakename} datasets revealed that the average total length of a full entry, comprising first name, surname, and date of birth, is approximately 21 characters.
Given that 2-grams are used for encoding, this corresponds to roughly 20 overlapping 2-grams per entry.
Consequently, the baseline is defined by selecting the top $k=20$ most frequent 2-grams across the entire dataset and predicting this fixed set for every test record.
This naive method disregards any record specific characteristics and instead reflects a population wide frequency-based guess, serving as a simple yet informative lower bound for comparison.

The result is a dataset specific set of baseline metrics.
These are mainly precision, recall, F1-score, and Dice similarity, against which the \ac{dea} model's predictions can be compared.
These baseline metrics vary with dataset size, since the n-gram frequency distribution shifts with the number of records.
The aggregated results of the baseline performance across datasets are visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:baseline_metrics}.

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:baseline_metrics}, the guessing-based baseline yields relatively stable performance across increasing dataset sizes.
While precision values remain low, around 0.215, recall consistently exceeds 0.245, reflecting that common n-grams are disproportionately favored by the baseline strategy.
This results in F1 scores clustering near 0.230, with similarly low Dice similarity scores.
Notably, the limited variance across dataset sizes suggests that the baseline’s effectiveness is only marginally impacted by the scale of the dataset, despite shifts in n-gram frequency distributions.
These findings reinforce the role of the baseline as a simple, size-agnostic lower bound against which more sophisticated, learning-based \ac{dea} models can be benchmarked.

    \label{fig:baseline_metrics}
\end{figure}

For the \texttt{euro\_person} dataset, the baseline strategy for evaluating the effectiveness of the \ac{dea} follows the same procedure as for the \texttt{fakename} dataset.
Specifically, the k most frequent n-grams in the training data are used to simulate a naïve guessing approach.
Based on the analysis of this dataset, the average length of a full entry, comprising forename, surname, and full date of birth, is approximately 20 characters.
Assuming the use of 2-grams with overlapping character windows, this corresponds to around 19 distinct 2-grams per entry.
As a baseline, the top 19 most frequent 2-grams are selected and uniformly predicted for each record, independent of the individual characteristics of the entries.

The resulting performance metrics for this baseline prediction indicate a precision of 0.2197, a recall of 0.2446, and an F1-score of 0.2306.
These values provide an important reference point for evaluating the added value of the \ac{dea} pipeline, as they quantify the effectiveness of a purely frequency driven reconstruction approach.

For the \texttt{titanic\_full} dataset, the average length of a full entry (consisting of given name and surname) is approximately 26 characters, indicating relatively high complexity due to longer and often multi-token names.
Therefore the top 25 most frequent 2-grams are selected as the baseline for reconstruction.
The baseline reconstruction approach achieved a precision of 0.2468, a recall of 0.3770, and an F1 score of 0.2896.
These modest performance values reflect the structural challenges posed by the dataset, including the presence of honorifics, compound names, and non-standard formatting.
The results suggest that even a naïve guessing strategy can partially recover plaintext identifiers, but also establish a meaningful lower bound for evaluating the performance improvements of learning-based approaches such as the \ac{dea}.

Notably, for the \texttt{titanic\_full} dataset, the overlap ratio used in the experiments was adjusted to the set \{0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9\}.
This adaptation was necessary because the dataset is relatively small, and the \ac{gma} fails to identify any individuals at lower overlap values.
Meaningful results only begin to emerge at an overlap of 0.7 or higher.

Notably, the similarity of the baseline metrics to those obtained on the \texttt{fakename} and \texttt{euro\_person} dataset highlights the generality of the method across synthetic and semi-realistic datasets, further justifying its inclusion as a comparative benchmark.

\section{Analysis}  \label{sec:analysis}

In this section the results of the \ac{dea} experiments are presented and analyzed.
The analysis is structured into several subsections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the \ac{dea} performance.
As described in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}, the experiments were conducted across multiple datasets, encoding schemes, overlaps and drop from strategies.
Therefore, several of these configuration settings will be fixed to analyze the impact of the remaining parameters on the \ac{dea} performance.

One important aspect especially for smaller datasets and overlap sizes is, that it could occur that the \ac{gma} does not identify any individuals, i.e., the re-identification set is empty.
In this case, the \ac{dea} is not able to reconstruct any plaintext information.
This is the case because if there are no re-identified individuals in place, there is no training data for the \ac{dea} available.
Therefore the results of these experiments are not reported and the corresponding data points are excluded from the analysis and plots.

\subsection{\ac{tmh}}

The following subsection focuses on the results obtained using the \ac{tmh} encoding scheme.
In this analysis, each dataset is evaluated under varying experimental conditions.
To ensure consistency, the dataset and encoding scheme are fixed, while the evaluation focuses on the impact of different overlap sizes and drop-from strategies.


\paragraph{Titanic Full}

The \ac{dea} using \ac{tmh} encoding achieves strong F1 scores on the Titanic dataset, with a peak of 0.76 for \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} and 0.68 for \texttt{DropFrom = Both} at overlap 0.9.
This performance is largely driven by high precision (above 0.9) and improved recall for higher Recall, especially for Eve at 0.8 overlap (0.64).
Compared to lower overlap scenarios, the model benefits dramatically from increasing training data.
While Both initially underperforms Eve at 0.7–0.8, the gap narrows at higher overlap values.

No successful re-identifications are observed, neither fuzzy nor greedy matchers identify any records across overlaps.
Despite solid structural learning, the model remains ineffective at perfectly linking back to individual identities on this dataset.

The hyper optimization validation scores slightly underestimate the training F1, but overall performance is close, particularly at higher overlaps.

In summary, \ac{tmh} performs well on the Titanic dataset in terms of predictive accuracy, but fails to achieve individual re-identification under the evaluated conditions.


\paragraph{Fakename 1k}

The \ac{dea} evaluation on the \ac{tmh} encoding for the fakename 1k dataset reveals several trends.
When using the \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} configuration, the \ac{dea} consistently outperforms the baseline F1 score for overlaps higher than 0.4.
Specifically, at overlaps of 0.6 and 0.8, the trained F1 score reaches approximately 0.54 and 0.58 respectively, clearly surpassing the baseline of around 0.2.
This improvement is also reflected in the recall, which increases from about 0.11 at 0.4 overlap to over 0.42 at 0.8.
Precision remains consistently high for Eve (above 0.95 across all overlaps), indicating that while not all matches are found, those that are predicted are likely correct.
In contrast, the \texttt{DropFrom = Both} configuration shows weaker performance, only approaching the baseline F1 at the highest overlap (0.8), with notably lower recall and precision in all other settings.
Interesting is the spike of precision at 0.8 overlap to nearly 0.9.

Despite the promising F1 scores, the actual re-identification rate remains at 0\% across all overlaps and drop from strategies.
None of the applied re-identification methods could recover any individual's true identity, indicating that while the model learns statistical patterns, it does not enable perfect linkage to plaintext identities.

When comparing trained F1 scores against the F1 score during hyper parameter optimization, all points lie below the $x = y$ line, suggesting that the trained model performs worse then during hyper paraemter optimization.
This underestimation highlights that the hyper optimization metric may be conservative and not fully reflect the model’s potential when applied to the entire dataset again.

Overall, these results show that the \ac{dea} can exploit structural patterns in \ac{tmh} encodings effectively.
However, the inability to re-identify individuals directly suggests that while aggregate information can be extracted, privacy at the individual level is maintained under these conditions.

\paragraph{Fakename 2k}

Compared to the 1k dataset, the \ac{dea} performance on the 2k version shows even clearer improvements when using \texttt{DropFrom = Eve}.
At overlaps of 0.6 and 0.8, the trained F1 reaches 0.58 and 0.72 respectively, again clearly surpassing the baseline.
Recall increases substantially (up to 0.61 at 0.8), and precision remains high (>0.9) except for a dip at 0.6.
In contrast, the \texttt{DropFrom = Both} strategy performs poorly across all metrics, with only marginal gains in F1 and recall.

Similar to the 1k case, the re-identification rate remains 0\% for all overlap levels and matching methods, reaffirming that the model exploits structural patterns but fails to link any record back to its plaintext identity.
The generalization gap observed in the \texttt{hyper optimization vs. Full F1} plot persists, with trained performance consistently exceeding validation scores.

Overall, the trend confirms that increasing dataset size and overlap improves \ac{dea} effectiveness under the Eve setting, while direct re-identification remains infeasible.

\paragraph{Fakename 5k}

With the larger fakename 5k dataset, the \ac{dea} achieves its strongest results so far, especially for \texttt{DropFrom = Eve}.
F1 peaks at 0.87 for overlap 0.6 and remains above 0.7 across higher overlaps.
Precision nearly saturates at 1.0, while recall reaches 0.79.
Compared to the 1k and 2k datasets, both the quality and stability of predictions improve.
Even the \texttt{DropFrom = Both} configuration becomes effective, surpassing the baseline for overlaps $\geq$ 0.6.

For the first time, a small number of re-identifications occur: up to 1.2\% (Eve) and 0.01\% (Both) at overlap 0.6.
These are still rare, but mark a turning point in the attack’s ability to directly reconstruct individuals.
The validation F1 (hyper optimization) continues to underestimate final performance, though the gap is narrower than in smaller datasets.

These results indicate that with sufficient data volume and overlap, the \ac{dea} begins to break through into direct re-identification.

\paragraph{Fakename 10k}

With 10{,}000 records, the \ac{dea} reaches good performance.
For \texttt{DropFrom = Eve}, the trained F1 climbs above 0.9 (overlap $\geq$ 0.6), and recall reaches 0.91, far exceeding the baseline.
Precision saturates at nearly 1.0 across both drop strategies.
Notably, \texttt{DropFrom = Both} also becomes effective with increasing overlap, achieving an F1 of 0.9 at overlap 0.8.
Compared to the 5k dataset, all metrics improve further in both quality and consistency.

Importantly, re-identification becomes significant: up to 5.3\% for Eve and 2.9\% for Both at overlap 0.8, marking the first clear success in reconstructing individual identities.
Greedy and fuzzy matching both contribute, with their combined result performing best.
As in previous experiments, the validation F1 underestimates final performance, though the top points begin to approach the $x = y$ line.

Overall, this setting shows that the \ac{dea} not only recovers accurate group-level patterns but now also breaches individual privacy when data size and overlap are high.

\paragraph{Fakename 20k}

On the this dataset so far, the \ac{dea} reaches its highest effectiveness.
Trained F1 exceeds 0.9 for both \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} and \texttt{DropFrom = Both} at overlap 0.8.
Recall remains above 0.9 for Eve and 0.86 for Both, with near-perfect precision across all settings.
Unlike smaller datasets, the Both strategy now reliably outperforms the baseline, even at lower overlap, demonstrating that \ac{dea} benefits from both increased data volume and redundancy.

Re-identification becomes alarmingly effective: Eve strategy enables recovery of up to 13.2\% of individuals at overlap 0.8, while Both strategy yields up to 10.2\%.
The gap between matching strategies is consistent across all dataset sizes.
The \emph{greedy} matching always outperforms \emph{fuzzy}, indicating that more confident matches are made based on graph-based reconstruction.
The generalization gap between validation and full data F1 narrows for high-performing runs, but underfitting remains visible at lower overlaps.

In summary, at 20k records, the \ac{dea} no longer just learns structure, it reliably performs direct re-identification.
The attack is most effective under the Eve strategy with high overlap, but Both is no longer a safe configuration as well.

\paragraph{Europerson}

For the euro person dataset, the \ac{dea} again achieves strong results across all overlaps and configurations.
Trained F1 scores are consistently high, peaking at 0.95 for both \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} and \texttt{Both}, above the baseline.
Recall and precision also remain high across all settings, suggesting stable and reliable model behavior.
Unlike the fakename datasets, the Both strategy performs comparably well or even slightly better than Eve in terms of F1, indicating that the model generalizes robustly even when information is dropped symmetrically.

Re-identification is effective but concentrated at overlap 0.6, reaching 6.7\% for Both and 6.1\% for Eve.
As in previous datasets, \emph{greedy} matching consistently outperforms \emph{fuzzy}.
This reaffirms earlier observations that greedy matching is more effective for this task.
The drop in re-identification rates at overlap 0.8, despite high model performance, suggests potential saturation effects or ambiguity in the match space.

However, the \texttt{hyper optimization vs. Full F1} plot shows nearly perfect correlation, suggesting excellent validation accuracy and minimal overfitting, marking a notable improvement over previous runs.

In summary, the \ac{dea} remains highly effective on the euro person dataset, with robust re-identification capabilities and strong generalization, especially under symmetric drop scenarios.

\paragraph{Fakename 50k}


\subsection{\ac{tsh}}

\paragraph{Titanic Full}

The \ac{tsh} encoding yields consistently strong \ac{dea} performance on the Titanic dataset.
F1 scores steadily increase with overlap, reaching 0.79 for \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} and 0.80 for \texttt{DropFrom = Both} at 0.9 overlap.
This balanced performance across both configurations is supported by high precision values, above 0.95 for Both, and recall values climbing to over 0.74.
Unlike \ac{tmh}, which favored Eve at lower overlaps, \ac{tsh} appears more stable and symmetric in terms of learned patterns.

Despite the good predictive performance, re-identification remains unsuccessful.
No matches are found using fuzzy or greedy strategies, indicating that while structural properties are recoverable, they do not yet support direct re-identification under these conditions.
The validation to full F1 correlation is especially tight at higher overlaps, with only a minor underestimation in one configuration.

In conclusion, \ac{tsh} performs reliably on the Titanic dataset, yielding high precision reconstructions but no re-identifications, similar in privacy behavior to the other encoding methods tested.

\paragraph{Fakename 1k}

For the fakename 1k dataset, the \ac{dea} using \ac{tsh} encoding achieves clear improvements over the baseline when overlap increases.
Under \texttt{DropFrom = Eve}, the trained F1 reaches 0.72 at overlap 0.8, accompanied by a precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.60.
The \texttt{DropFrom = Both} configuration lags behind at lower overlaps, but catches up by overlap 0.8 with an F1 of 0.65.
This performance is again driven by strong precision values (0.97) and rising recall.
Overall, \ac{tsh} enables the model to learn discriminative patterns effectively, even with a relatively small dataset.

Despite these promising predictive results, no re-identifications were observed for any overlap or drop strategy.
Both fuzzy and greedy matchers yielded a re-identifcation rate of 0\%, indicating that while the model successfully reconstructs structure, individual identities remain protected in this setting.

The hyperparameter optimization validation scores follow the full data F1 trend with reasonable alignment, though slightly underestimated at high overlaps.
These results suggest that even at small scale, \ac{tsh} supports stable and accurate structure reconstruction, but without enabling perfect re-identification.


\paragraph{Fakename 2k}

With 2{,}000 records, the \ac{dea} performance improves significantly across both dropout strategies.
For \texttt{DropFrom = Eve}, the trained F1 reaches 0.77 at overlap 0.6 and 0.82 at 0.8.
The model achieves precision values above 0.9 while recall steadily increases, indicating that \ac{tsh} enables the model to identify consistent structure as overlap grows.
Interestingly, the \texttt{DropFrom = Both} configuration, while initially lagging, catches up at overlap 0.8, where it reaches an F1 of 0.84, slightly outperforming Eve in this setting.

Re-identification remains very limited.
A few individual matches occur at higher overlaps, with a combined re-identification rate of 0.11\% for Eve at overlap 0.6 and 0.29\% for Both at 0.8.
These are isolated and do not suggest a systematic breach.
As seen previously, the successful re-identifications primarily stem from greedy matches, with fuzzy matching contributing marginally or not at all.

The hyperparameter optimization F1 estimates closely follow the full trained F1 values, particularly for the top-performing settings.
Overall, the model demonstrates reliable learning behavior with growing structural accuracy, and only marginal re-identification leakage under favorable conditions.


\paragraph{Fakename 5k}

On the fakename 5k dataset, the \ac{dea} achieves robust structural reconstruction for both dropout strategies.
For \texttt{DropFrom = Both}, the trained F1 increases steadily with overlap, peaking at 0.94 at overlap 0.8.
Eve performs similarly, reaching an F1 of 0.89 at overlap 0.6, followed by a slight drop.
Precision remains high across all settings (>0.95), while recall shows a consistent upward trend, reflecting stable learning behavior.

Re-identification becomes more prominent in this setting.
For Eve, the combined re-identification rate reaches 2.1\% at overlap 0.6, with contributions from both greedy and fuzzy matching.
For Both, the re-identifcation rate peaks at 5.5\% at overlap 0.8, the highest observed so far in this encoding scheme.
Greedy matching again proves to be the dominant source of correct identifications, though fuzzy matching contributes increasingly at high overlap.

The hyperparameter optimization validation F1 aligns well with full-data F1, especially in the upper range, and reliably tracks the performance trend.
Overall, \ac{tsh} demonstrates its strongest re-identification capabilities in this setting so farh, especially under symmetric dropout and high overlap, confirming its vulnerability to structure-based leakage under \ac{dea}.


\paragraph{Fakename 10k}

On the fakename 10k dataset, the \ac{dea} again shows strong structure reconstruction under both dropout strategies.
The trained F1 exceeds 0.9 for \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} at overlap 0.6 and reaches 0.95 for \texttt{DropFrom = Both} at overlap 0.8.
Precision values remain consistently high (>0.95), while recall grows steadily, indicating stable learning behavior with increasing overlap.
An exception occurs at overlap 0.6 under Both, where model performance drops sharply, likely due to instability in hyperparameter selection.

Re-identification becomes significant in this setting.
For Eve, the combined re-identifciation rate peaks at 11.1\% at overlap 0.6, with greedy matching again dominating.
Both also yield a strong re-identifcation rate, reaching 5.6\% at overlap 0.8.
Fuzzy matching contributes modestly in all settings but never exceeds greedy performance.

Despite the outlier at 0.6 for Both, the hyperparameter optimization F1 generally tracks full-data performance reliably, especially for high-performing configurations.
These results highlight that \ac{tsh} poses a substantial re-identification risk when enough structural redundancy is present in the data, particularly under asymmetric dropout and moderate-to-high overlap.


\paragraph{Fakename 20k}

\paragraph{Europerson}

On the euro person dataset, the \ac{dea} yields near-perfect reconstruction performance under both dropout strategies.
Trained F1 scores exceed 0.98 at overlap 0.6 and 0.8, with both Eve and Both achieving precision and recall values above 0.97.
This reflects that the \ac{tsh} encoding retains highly discriminative structural patterns when applied to this dataset.
The strong performance is consistent and stable across overlap values, and the hyperparameter optimization validation scores closely track the final F1, indicating reliable model selection.

Re-identification rates are substantial in this setting.
Under Eve, the combined re-ID rate reaches 23.1\% at both 0.6 and 0.8 overlap.
For Both, the rate follows closely with 21.9\% at overlap 0.8.
Greedy matching again contributes the majority of successful matches, but fuzzy matching begins to play a more significant role at higher overlaps.
These rates indicate that \ac{tsh} not only enables structural reconstruction but also allows for substantial identity recovery when the dataset structure is dense and consistent.

This result confirms that for structurally rich datasets, \ac{tsh} can be highly vulnerable to dataset extension attacks.
The re-identification potential under both symmetric and asymmetric dropout is pronounced and grows rapidly with overlap.


\subsection{\ac{bf}}

\paragraph{Titanic Full}

The \ac{dea} achieves high trained F1 scores on the Titanic dataset, peaking at 0.83 for \texttt{DropFrom = Both} and 0.81 for \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} at overlap 0.8.
Precision and recall both exceed 0.9 and 0.7 respectively in these top performing settings, indicating that the model successfully captures structural patterns from \ac{bf} encodings.
Compared to other datasets, performance is already strong at overlaps 0.7–0.9, and Both performs equally well or slightly better than Eve, suggesting that sufficient redundancy exists even under symmetric dropout.

Despite strong classification results, no successful re-identifications are observed across any setting.
Both fuzzy and greedy matching produce 0\% re-identifications, showing that although the model generalizes well, it does not achieve individual level deanonymization on this dataset.

Overall, while the model effectively learns link structures in the Titanic data, it falls short of re-identification, likely due to the dataset’s size and feature variability.


\paragraph{Fakename 1k}

On the fakename 1k dataset, the \ac{dea} using \ac{bf} encoding begins to show effective learning behavior under the \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} setting.
The trained F1 score improves with overlap, reaching 0.68 at 0.8, far above the baseline.

This increase is driven by a steady rise in recall (from 0.04 to 0.53) and consistently high precision (up to 0.93).
In contrast, the \texttt{DropFrom = Both} configuration fails to show meaningful improvements, with F1 scores plateauing below 0.2 and recall staying low despite overlap increases.

Despite strong F1 gains, no successful re-identifications are observed across any configuration or overlap.
Both greedy and fuzzy matching yield 0\% re-identification, indicating that while the model captures structural information, it cannot yet link encoded entries to plaintext identities.

The validation F1 (hyper optimization) underestimates full-data performance, especially for higher overlaps, consistent with trends seen in early-stage \ac{dea} setups.
In summary, the \ac{bf} \ac{dea} on the 1k dataset demonstrates its first signs of structural reconstruction under Eve only dropout, though without successful individual level re-identification.

\paragraph{Fakename 2k}

With 2{,}000 records, the \ac{dea} shows improvements over the 1k setup, especially for \texttt{DropFrom = Eve}.
The trained F1 rises sharply with overlap, reaching 0.86 at 0.8.
Recall increases to 0.8, and precision remains above 0.9, showing the model's growing capacity to identify correct patterns in \ac{bf} encodings.
In comparison, the \texttt{DropFrom = Both} strategy improves slightly but remains less effective, with F1 peaking at 0.72 and lower recall across all overlaps.

For the first time, successful re-identifications occur: up to 1.5\% for Eve and 0.3\% for Both at overlap 0.8.
As observed earlier, \emph{greedy} matching begins to outperform \emph{fuzzy} as overlap increases, indicating stronger exact-match results within the learned representations.

The hyper optimization metric still slightly underestimates final F1, but the gap narrows compared to the 1k dataset.
Overall, the model transitions from pattern learning to early-stage identity reconstruction, particularly under asymmetric dropout and high overlap.


\paragraph{Fakename 5k}

On the 5{,}000-record dataset, the \ac{dea} shows strong and increasingly stable performance.
Trained F1 peaks at 0.93 for \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} and 0.91 for \texttt{Both}, both at overlap 0.6, higher than in the 2k setting.
Precision approaches 0.98–0.99, and recall exceeds 0.85, confirming the model's ability to learn accurate structures from \ac{bf} encodings.
Interestingly, at overlap 0.8, performance slightly drops for Eve, while Both remains stable, suggesting that excessive overlap might reduce contrast for learning.

Re-identification becomes meaningful: the Eve strategy yields up to 5.1\% at overlap 0.6, and Both up to 1.6\%.
The dominant share of successful re-identifications again comes from \emph{greedy} matching, confirming its higher effectiveness over \emph{fuzzy}.
These findings mark the transition from merely reconstructing structure to reliably mapping individual identities.
As with earlier datasets, the hyper optimization validation score slightly underestimates final F1, though the correlation improves—especially for high-performing overlaps.

Overall, the 5k setting marks the first consistently successful phase of both structural learning and individual re-identification across dropout strategies.


\paragraph{Fakename 10k}

With 10{,}000 records, the \ac{dea} continues to scale effectively.
Trained F1 scores reach 0.94 for \texttt{DropFrom = Eve} and 0.91 for \texttt{Both} at overlap 0.6, confirming stable structural learning across both asymmetric and symmetric dropout settings.
Recall and precision remain very high (above 0.9) in all top-performing configurations.
Performance slightly drops at overlap 0.8, indicating potential over-saturation in the match space.

Re-identification becomes substantial: Eve yields a combined re-identification rate of 11.1\% and Both up to 7.9\% at overlap 0.6.
As in earlier datasets, \emph{greedy} matching consistently outperforms \emph{fuzzy}, with both contributing to the combined rate.
This confirms the dominance of greedy strategies in reliably identifying true matches in \ac{bf} space.
Interestingly, re-identification performance dips again at 0.8 overlap, despite high F1, suggesting increased ambiguity among highly similar records.
Validation F1 (hyper optimization) aligns closely with final results in high-performing runs, while low-overlap settings still show significant underestimation.

In summary, the 10k setting demonstrates mature \ac{dea} capabilities on \ac{bf}s: both structure and identity are increasingly recovered, with Eve offering the highest success rates under intermediate overlap conditions.
